To use Postman, you first need to install the application on your computer.

Once you have launched Postman, click on the "New" button and then select "HTTP Request". 

From there, you can choose the method you want to use, such as GET, and then enter the URL for the information you want to retrieve.

For example, if you want information about computers, you would use the URL http://localhost:3000/televisions. 

If you want information about audio, mobiles, or television, you can replace "computers" with the appropriate term. 

This also applies to the methods POST, PUT, and DELETE.
